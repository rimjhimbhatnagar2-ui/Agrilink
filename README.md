# Agrilink
We proposed Agrilink, a web platform that connects companies directly with farmers.The platform acts as a single middleman (eliminating collectors, wholesalers, mandi agents etc) and delivers vegetables directly to companies and firms from farmers.
On agrilink companies can place bulk orders of any regional and seasonal vegetables and fruits. Companies can set time by which they want delivery.
